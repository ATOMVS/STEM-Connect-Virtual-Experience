Write a formal & informative, but short development proposal for the following project:

1) Private dashboard with health status of the 9 machines in each of Daikibo's 4 factories, for which they collect telemetry.

2) Access to the page happens only within client's Intranet.

3) Authentication is synced to internal authentication server (users can leverage their company-wide accounts).

4) The dashboard consists of a single page, listing the current statuses of all monitored devices.

5) The view is collapsible/expandable at a factory level, as well as device level (showing history of statuses). 

What to include (please take a look at the document template):

1) Overview
An intro to the proposal and a high-level description of the project

2) Scope
Describe the functionality of the project
Reference the graphics included in the template

3) Estimate
A total man-hour estimate + breakdown for Development, Testing, and Integration

4) Timeline
List the milestones of the project

5) Support
Let the client know they can rely on continuous product support (bug fixes, support tickets, new functionality)
For this task you will need an office package - MS Office works if you have that, but you can also use a free software like Libre Office (find a link in the Resources). Please find a template for your proposal document in the Resources. Keeping the document as long as it is in the template (in terms of number of pages) is a good idea.
