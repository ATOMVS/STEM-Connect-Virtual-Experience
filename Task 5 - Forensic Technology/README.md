We have processed all data on employee compensation and we've generated an excel file (Equality Table.xlsx, available in the Resources) containing 3 columns:

Factory

Job Role

Equality Score (integer; ranging between -100 and +100; 0 is ideal)

Here is your final task:

Create a 4th column (Equality class), classifying the equality score in those 3 types:

Fair (+-10)

Unfair (<-10 AND >10)

Highly Discriminative (<-20 AND >20)

Examples:

6 → Fair

-9 → Unfair

-30 → Highly Discriminative

Please find the Equality Table you need to edit from the task's Resources. When you are done - upload the edited version of the file.
